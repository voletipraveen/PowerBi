Problem Statement:
	"Retail businesses often struggle to track sales performance, inventory efficiency, and regional trends in a unified view. The challenge was to design a dashboard that consolidates multiple Excel sources into a single interactive Power BI report, enabling stakeholders to filter data seamlessly, monitor KPIs, and gain actionable insights for decision-making."

Steps followed :
- Transformed raw Excel data into a structured Power BI model.
- Applied data cleaning and transformations, including adding calculated columns for reporting needs.
- Designed a star schema model to ensure efficient filtering and relationships.
- Created measures for KPIs and calculated columns to highlight performance metrics.
- Implemented slicers with sync functionality and bookmarks to provide a clear, interactive user experience.
- Published the final report to Power BI Service and created the dashboard for easy access and sharing.
